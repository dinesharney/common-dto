# Why Ignite Client and Server Have Common DTOs

In Apache Ignite, both the client and server share common DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to facilitate seamless communication and consistency between different components in the distributed system. Below are the key reasons for this approach:

## 1. Consistency Across Components
- By using common DTOs, both the client and server are aligned in terms of data structures. This ensures that when a client sends a request or query, the server can easily process it without needing any additional data transformation or mapping. Both sides expect the same format for the data, reducing the potential for errors.

## 2. Simplified Data Serialization/Deserialization
- Ignite uses serialization mechanisms to exchange data between the client and server. When both sides use the same DTOs, the process of serializing and deserializing data becomes straightforward. This helps maintain compatibility across versions and avoids the overhead of converting between different formats.

## 3. Performance Optimization
- Sharing DTOs between the client and server avoids redundant data transformations, which could slow down the system. By using common DTOs, data can be directly transferred and processed, improving the performance of network communication and reducing latency.

## 4. Easier Maintenance
- A single set of DTOs means there is only one model to maintain and evolve. This reduces the complexity of maintaining separate models for the client and server, ensuring that changes to the data model are consistent across the entire system.

## 5. Support for Client-Server Interactions
- Apache Ignite clients can execute distributed queries, operations, and transactions. Using the same DTOs on both the client and server ensures that the logic for query execution, data retrieval, and result formatting is unified. This makes the interactions between clients and servers more efficient.

## 6. Cross-Language Support
- Ignite clients can be implemented in multiple languages (such as Java, .NET, C++, etc.), and having a common DTO format across these clients and the Ignite server allows for seamless communication. It simplifies integration by ensuring that the data format is language-agnostic, which is critical in distributed systems.

## 7. API Simplification
- When the client and server share DTOs, the API for interacting with Ignite becomes more intuitive and unified. Clients donâ€™t have to deal with complex data mapping logic when interacting with the server, as they can use the same DTOs to send and receive data.
